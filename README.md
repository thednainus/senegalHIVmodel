# Senegal HIV Model

This repository contains the research compendium organized as an R package for Nascimento _et al_. 2018. Here you can find all scripts and data used in our paper. Vignettes are also provided to reproduce our analysis.

Please note that the functions provided in this research compendium were optimized for our data, and might not work to your own data as it is. However, reproducing our analysis using the vignettes may help you setting up your own analysis for epidemiology using structured coaslecent models as described in [Volz, 2012](http://www.genetics.org/content/190/1/187).
