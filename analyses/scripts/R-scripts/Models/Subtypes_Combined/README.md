**Model 2**

We assigned each sequence to its respective risk-group in the phylogenetic tree a value of 1.0 (100% in the respective self-reported risk group).

**Model 3**

Also to assume uncertainty in the self-reported *gpm* (heterosexual males from the general population), we removed all *gpm* sequences from the phylogenetic tree.

**Model 4**

We assumed some uncertainty in the self-reported *gpm* by assigning to every *gpm* sequence a value of 0.5 (50%) of being *gpm* and 0.5 (50%) of being *msm* (men who have sex with other men).

**Model 5**

We assigned each sequence to its respective risk-group in the phylogenetic tree a value of 1.0 (100% in the respective self-reported risk group) and added the prevalence term to the calculation of the likelihood.

**Model 6**

Also to assumed uncertainty in the self-reported *gpm*, we removed all *gpm* sequences from the phylogenetic tree and added the prevalence term to the calculation of the likelihood. This plot is only shown in the main text.

**Model 7**

We assumed some uncertainty in the self-reported *gpm* by assigning to every *gpm* sequence a value of 0.5 (50%) of being \textit{gpm} and 0.5 (50%) of being *msm* and added the prevalence term to the calculation of the likelihood.
