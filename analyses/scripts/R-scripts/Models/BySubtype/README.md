**Model 1**

We assigned each sequence to its respective risk-group in the phylogenetic tree a value of 1.0 (100% in the respective self-reported risk group).

**Model 2**

We assumed some uncertainty in the self-reported *gpm* (heterosexual males from the general population) by assigning to every *gpm* sequence a value of 0.5 (50%) of being *gpm* and 0.5 (50%) of being *msm* (men who have sex with other men).

**Model 3**

We assigned each sequence to its respective risk-group in the phylogenetic tree a value of 1.0 (100% in the respective self-reported risk group) and added the prevalence term to the calculation of the likelihood.

**Model 4**

We assumed some uncertainty in the self-reported *gpm* by assigning to every *gpm* sequence a value of 0.5 (50%) of being *gpm* and 0.5 (50%) of being *msm*. We also added the prevalence term to the calculation of the likelihood.
