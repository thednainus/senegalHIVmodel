*treedater_HIV_CGR_byCodon.R*
This script was used to carry out [treedater](https://github.com/emvolz/treedater) analyses for each subtype. It also has some code for checking bootstrapped trees.

*merge_trees.R*
This script was used to merge each [treedater](https://github.com/emvolz/treedater) phylogenetic tree as a polytomy. This merged tree was then used in the phylodynamic analyses.
